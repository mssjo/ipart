# Precomputes integer partitions for FORM
# This can be implemented in FORM but makes for much clumsier code
#
# First argument is the integer, second is a single letter specifying the kind of partition:
#   o - ordered: elements of each partition are ordered in descending order (this is the typical mathematical sense)
#   u - unordered: order of elements is free and different orders are treated as distinct partitions
#   f - fixed-length: unordered, zero elements are permitted, number of elements is fixed by third argument
#  (default is o)
# Generates the partitions in lexicographic order using a straightforward recursive algorithm with caching.
# Prints them to the screen and prepares a form file called ipart/(concatenation of arguments).hf

# These three implemetations are very similar, but a bit of code repitition is clearer
